\\Based on the big evolution of the electronic devices in the las 35 years and in the recent new hardwares of low cost computational power, this thesis has the goal of presenting a software and hardware for real time simulation and control of conveyor belt tunnel oven using low cost embedded hardware to ensure the production quality. For this purpose, mathematical modeling and simulation of the temperature profile inside the oven was realized in order to supply the control system with the temperature on the food in real time, using only the fixed sensors of the oven. This simulation information is passed to the PID control, ensuring that the desired temperature profile for the heating of the food is accomplished, improving the quality of the final product.
